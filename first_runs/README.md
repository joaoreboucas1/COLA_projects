# Reproducing Figures 6.1 and 6.2 from Guilherme's thesis
This consists in running 7 COLA simulations:
 - Reference: h = 0.67, Omega_b = 0.049, Omega_m = 0.319, As = 2.1e+9, ns = 0.96, \sum mnu = 0.058
 - Low Omega_m: same as ref, but Omega_m = 0.28
 - High Omega_m: Omega_m = 0.36
 - Low As: As = 1.7e+9
 - High As: As = 2.5e+9
 - Low ns: ns = 0.92
 - High ns: ns = 1
The COLA specifications are in Table 6.1 from the thesis:
 - Volume: 1024^3 (Mpc/h)^3
 - Number of particles: 1024^3
 - Number of Particle-Mesh grids: 2048^3
 - Initial redshift: 19 (see table B.1)
